# whole
Adapter functions for C++ algorithm/numeric functions. The idea is to have a set of functions that iterate over the *whole* container rather than passing in a range of iterators.

Yes, [Boost.Range](http://boost.org/libs/range) exists. Yes, [ericniebler/range-v3](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) exists. If you want actual implementations for something like what is in this repository then those are likely better suited for whatever it is you are doing.

Started coding these for educational purposes and personal use.
